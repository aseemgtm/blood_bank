# blood_bank
 
A simple blood bank database management webapp built using Django, Python, Html, Bootstrap, CSS
You would have to add your postgres database name and password in the settings.py
And also need to create "EMAIL_ID" and "EMAIL_PASS" path variables in your system to send the password change request mails.
Some basic knowledge of Django framework would be required to run the program properly.
